*[Note: Include screenshot of create session page]*

```javascript
// Session Creation Form Implementation
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (!formData.sessionName.trim()) {
    setError('Session name is required');
    return;
  }
  
  const sessionData = {
    sessionName: formData.sessionName,
    language: formData.language,
    duration: parseInt(formData.duration),
    maxParticipants: parseInt(formData.maxParticipants),
    code: formData.code,
    editMode: formData.editMode,
    participants: {},
    comments: [],
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    hostId: null
  };
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/session', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ roomCode, sessionData }),
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    if (result.success) {
      router.push(`/session/${roomCode}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    setError('Failed to create session');
  }
};
```

## 4. Real-Time Communication Implementation

The real-time communication system forms the backbone of the collaborative platform, implemented using Socket.IO for reliable bidirectional communication between clients and the server. The WebSocket architecture supports multiple concurrent sessions with isolated communication channels.

**Figure 8: WebSocket Connection Management**
*[Note: Include code snippet showing socket connection setup]*

```javascript
// Socket.IO Event Handling System
useEffect(() => {
  socketRef.current = io(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL || 'http://localhost:3000');
  
  socketRef.current.on('connect', () => {
    setIsConnected(true);
    socketRef.current.emit('join-session', {
      roomCode: params.roomCode,
      participant: {
        id: `user_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
        name: participantName,
        joinedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        score: 0,
        commentsCount: 0,
        votesReceived: 0
      }
    });
  });
  
  socketRef.current.on('session-state', (data) => {
    setSessionData(data);
    setParticipants(data.participants || []);
    setComments(data.comments || []);
    setCode(data.code || '');
    setIsHost(data.isHost);
    setCanEdit(data.canEdit);
  });
  
  socketRef.current.on('participant-joined', (data) => {
    setParticipants(data.participants);
    setSessionData(prev => ({ ...prev, hostId: data.hostId }));
  });
  
  return () => {
    if (socketRef.current) {
      socketRef.current.disconnect();
    }
  };
}, [params.roomCode, participantName]);
```

**Figure 9: Real-Time Event Handling Implementation**

The server-side Socket.IO implementation manages multiple event types including session joining, code synchronization, comment management, and participant interactions. Each event handler includes comprehensive error handling and validation to ensure system stability.

**Figure 10: Server-Side Socket Event Management**
*[Note: Include screenshot of server.js socket event handlers]*

Real-time code synchronization ensures that all participants see code changes instantly, with conflict resolution mechanisms preventing data corruption during simultaneous edits. The typing indicator system provides visual feedback when participants are actively editing code.

## 5. Advanced Code Editor Implementation

The code editor component represents a sophisticated integration of CodeMirror 6 with custom extensions for collaborative features. The editor supports syntax highlighting for eight programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, and JSON.

**Figure 11: CodeMirror Integration and Language Support**
*[Note: Include screenshot showing different language syntax highlighting]*

```javascript
// CodeMirror Configuration with Extensions
const extensions = [
  basicSetup,
  languageExtensions[language] || javascript(),
  oneDark,
  EditorView.theme({
    '&': {
      height: '100%',
      fontSize: '14px',
    },
    '.cm-focused': {
      outline: 'none',
    },
    '.cm-editor': {
      height: '100%',
    },
    '.cm-scroller': {
      overflow: 'auto',
      height: '100%',
    },
  }),
  EditorView.updateListener.of((update) => {
    if (update.docChanged && canEdit) {
      const newCode = update.state.doc.toString();
      setCode(newCode);
      
      if (socketRef.current && isConnected) {
        socketRef.current.emit('code-change', {
          roomCode,
          code: newCode
        });
      }
    }
  }),
  keymap.of([
    {
      key: 'Ctrl-/',
      run: () => {
        // Toggle comment functionality
        return true;
      },
    },
    {
      key: 'Ctrl-s',
      run: () => {
        // Save functionality
        return true;
      },
    },
  ]),
];
```

**Figure 12: CodeMirror Configuration and Extensions**

The commenting system allows participants to add line-specific comments and inline annotations, with real-time synchronization across all connected clients. Comments include voting mechanisms to promote the most valuable feedback to the top of discussions.

**Figure 13: Line-Based Commenting Interface**
*[Note: Include screenshot showing comments attached to specific code lines]*

Permission management ensures that code editing rights can be controlled by session hosts, with granular controls for individual participants. The system supports both "host-only" and "collaborative" editing modes to accommodate different review scenarios.

## 6. Session Management and Data Persistence

The session management system implements a hybrid approach combining file-based persistence with in-memory caching for optimal performance. Session data is automatically saved to JSON files in the tmp/sessions directory, ensuring persistence across server restarts.

**Figure 14: Session Data Structure**
*[Note: Include screenshot of JSON session file structure]*

```javascript
// Session Storage Implementation
class FileSessionStore {
  constructor() {
    this.sessionsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'tmp', 'sessions');
    this.sessionCache = new Map();
    this.ensureSessionsDirectory();
    this.startCleanupTimer();
  }
  
  save(roomCode, sessionData) {
    try {
      const filePath = path.join(this.sessionsDir, `${roomCode}.json`);
      const dataToSave = {
        ...sessionData,
        lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
      };
      
      fs.writeFileSync(filePath, JSON.stringify(dataToSave, null, 2));
      this.sessionCache.set(roomCode, dataToSave);
      
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error saving session:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  get(roomCode) {
    if (this.sessionCache.has(roomCode)) {
      return this.sessionCache.get(roomCode);
    }
    
    try {
      const filePath = path.join(this.sessionsDir, `${roomCode}.json`);
      if (fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
        const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8'));
        this.sessionCache.set(roomCode, data);
        return data;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error loading session:', error);
    }
    
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Figure 15: File-Based Session Storage Implementation**

Automatic cleanup mechanisms remove expired sessions based on configurable timeouts, preventing storage overflow and maintaining system performance. Active session detection prevents conflicts when multiple sessions attempt to run simultaneously.

*[Note: Include screenshot of API route files structure]*

```javascript
// Session API Implementation
export async function POST(req) {
  try {
    const { roomCode, sessionData } = await req.json();
    
    // Validation
    if (!roomCode || !sessionData) {
      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({ 
          success: false, 
          error: 'roomCode and sessionData are required' 
        }),
        { status: 400, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
      );
    }
    
    // Check for existing active sessions
    const activeSessions = sessionStore.getActiveSessions();
    if (activeSessions.length > 0) {
      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({
          success: false,
          error: 'Only one session can be active at a time',
          activeSession: activeSessions[0]
        }),
        { status: 409, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
      );
    }
    
    // Create new session
    const success = sessionStore.save(roomCode, sessionData);
    
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ success }),
      { status: success ? 200 : 500, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
    );
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in POST /api/session:', error);
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ success: false, error: 'Internal server error' }),
      { status: 500, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
    );
  }
}
```

*[Note: Include screenshot of code execution panel interface]*

```javascript
// Secure Code Execution Implementation
class CodeExecutor {
  constructor() {
    this.timeoutMs = 10000; // 10 second timeout
    this.maxOutputSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB output limit
  }
  
  async executeJavaScript(code) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      try {
        // Create isolated execution context
        const vm = require('vm');
        const context = {
          console: {
            log: (...args) => {
              output += args.join(' ') + '\n';
            }
          },
          setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, clearInterval
        };
        
        let output = '';
        const script = new vm.Script(code);
        const contextObject = vm.createContext(context);
        
        // Execute with timeout
        const result = script.runInContext(contextObject, {
          timeout: this.timeoutMs,
          displayErrors: true
        });
        
        resolve({
          success: true,
          output: output.trim(),
          error: '',
          result: result
        });
        
      } catch (error) {
        resolve({
          success: false,
          output: '',
          error: error.message,
          result: null
        });
      }
    });
  }
}
```

**Figure 21: JavaScript Code Execution Implementation**

Resource monitoring ensures that code execution remains within defined limits, preventing resource exhaustion and maintaining system stability during concurrent execution requests.

              }`} />
              
              <div>
                <p className="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                  {participant.name}
                  {participant.id === hostId && (
                    <span className="ml-2 px-2 py-1 bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 text-xs rounded">
                      Host
                    </span>
                  )}
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  Score: {participant.score} | Comments: {participant.commentsCount}
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            {isHost && participant.id !== hostId && (
              <button
                onClick={() => onToggleEdit(participant.id, !participant.canEdit)}
                className={`px-3 py-1 text-xs rounded ${
                  participant.canEdit
                    ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800'
                    : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800'
                }`}
              >
                {participant.canEdit ? 'Can Edit' : 'Read Only'}
              </button>
            )}
          </div>

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setThrottledCallback(() => callback);
    }, delay);
    
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [callback, delay]);
  
  return throttledCallback;
};

// Usage in code editor
const throttledCodeChange = useThrottledCallback((newCode) => {
  if (socketRef.current && isConnected) {
    socketRef.current.emit('code-change', {
      roomCode,
      code: newCode
    });
  }
}, 300); // Throttle to 300ms
```

*[Note: Include code snippet showing validation functions]*

```javascript
// Security Validation Functions
const validateRoomCode = (code) => {
  const roomCodeRegex = /^[A-Z0-9]{6}$/;
  return roomCodeRegex.test(code);
};

const sanitizeInput = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== 'string') return '';
  
  return input
    .trim()
    .replace(/[<>]/g, '') // Remove potential HTML tags
    .substring(0, 1000); // Limit length
};

const validateSessionData = (data) => {
  const errors = [];
  
  if (!data.sessionName || data.sessionName.length < 3) {
    errors.push('Session name must be at least 3 characters');
  }
  
  if (!['javascript', 'python', 'java', 'cpp', 'html', 'css', 'sql', 'json'].includes(data.language)) {
    errors.push('Invalid programming language');
  }
  
  return errors;
};
```

**Figure 29: Security Validation Functions**

Rate limiting mechanisms prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation among users. The code execution environment implements sandboxing to prevent malicious code from affecting the host system.
