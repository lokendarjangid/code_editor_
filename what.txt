Sure Lokendar! Since you're using **Next.js**, here's a clear breakdown of **exactly what you need to build** for your project **Peer Rank – A Real-Time Collaborative Code Review Platform**:

---

## ✅ OVERVIEW

You’re building a **real-time browser-based platform** where students can:

* Join sessions without login
* View and review code snippets
* Give and receive feedback
* Vote on comments
* See rankings based on feedback quality

---

## 🧱 1. **Core Features to Build (Frontend + Backend)**

### 🔷 A. **Landing Page**

* Basic intro about Peer Rank
* “Enter Room Code” input
* “Create Session” button

---

### 🔷 B. **Join/Create Session Page**

* Create a unique session ID (or use a room code)
* Choose language for code snippets (e.g., Python, JS)
* Timer setup for review rounds (optional)

---

### 🔷 C. **Live Review Room**

**This is the main screen where collaboration happens:**

* 🧑‍💻 **Embedded Code Editor**

  * Use **CodeMirror** with syntax highlighting
  * Show preloaded code snippets

* 💬 **Real-Time Comments**

  * Comment box for users to give feedback on code
  * Show threaded comments live using **WebSockets**

* 🔼 **Voting System**

  * Users upvote helpful comments

* 🕒 **Session Timer**

  * Countdown clock for each review round

* 🎯 **Score Display**

  * Show points or feedback ratings per user

---

### 🔷 D. **Post-Session Summary**

* Show:

  * Comments made
  * Votes received
  * Peer ranking
  * Analytics (optional)

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Technical Backend Components**

### 📦 Built with:

* **Next.js App Router**
* **Firebase Realtime Database** *(or MongoDB)*
* **Socket.IO server** *(for real-time features)*
* **Next.js API routes** *(for REST endpoints, optional)*

---

### 🔄 Real-Time with Socket.IO

Use a custom Node.js server for WebSockets (or integrate Socket.IO with Next.js custom server if needed).

You’ll need to handle:

* New user joining
* New comment sent
* Vote cast
* Session timer sync
* Scoring calculation

---

## 📱 3. **Responsiveness**

* UI must work on:

  * Desktop
  * Tablet
  * Mobile

Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness.

---

## 🔐 4. **Optional but Important**

* **Flag/report inappropriate comments**
* **Anonymized feedback**
* **Session data saved securely**
* **Onboarding help/tutorial popups**

---

## 🚀 Deployment

* Use **Vercel** (ideal for Next.js)
* Optional: Use **Docker** if deploying elsewhere (Fly.io, AWS, etc.)
